## Data Science Specialization - course 2 - 2
  
  
**OBJETIVE**  
It is to be able to make use of the cache memory to store values that have a high cost of calculation process.  
  
**DESCRIPTION**  
For this task we will use two functions; makeVector and cachemean, the first one will serve us to make a calculation and the second function will serve us to store the value and later to be able to recover it.  
  
The term "Lexical Scope" defines a set of rules that the compiler uses to find a variable that has been defined in the programming algorithm.
In practice it is to be able to locate where the variables are set and their scope.  
  
An example:  
  
function foot(a){       # 1 ambit  
  
	var b = a * 2;        # 2 scope  
	function bar(c){      # 3 ambito  
		print(a, b, c);  
	}  
	bar(b * 3);           # 2 ambit  
  
}  
  
We execute the function by passing it a parameter = 2  
foot(2);   
  
the answer after executing the foot function is: 2, 4, 12  

**TASKS**  

```{r, echo=TRUE}

makeVector <- function(x = numeric()) {
        m <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                m <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setmean <- function(mean) m <<- mean
        getmean <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setmean = setmean,
             getmean = getmean)
}

cachemean <- function(x, ...) {
        m <- x$getmean()
        if(!is.null(m)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(m)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        m <- mean(data, ...)
        x$setmean(m)
        m
}


```

We run a calculation, example:  
  
```{r, echo=TRUE}
a <- makeVector(1:1000);
cachemean(a);
b <- cachemean(a);
b

```

**Conclusion**  
We have seen a practical example of the use of cache memory.
